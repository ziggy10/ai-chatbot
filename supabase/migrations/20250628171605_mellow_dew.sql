  # Fix app_settings RLS policies and ensure default row exists

  1. Security Changes
    - Fix RLS policies to allow authenticated users to access app_settings
    - Since app_settings is a singleton table (one row for entire app), all authenticated users should have access
    - Allow INSERT only if no row exists (singleton pattern)

  2. Data Integrity
    - Ensure default row exists after policy fixes
    - Remove any duplicate rows if they exist
